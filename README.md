- If you do not set the goal text, the timer will not start.
- Upon starting the timer, the clock may disappear. It can be accessed again by clicking the settings icon.
- After setting everything and starting your focus timer, if you click open settings to view your remaining timer, otherwise you not see your remaining time.
- ## Ensure the checkbox is selected to keep the window on top.
- The full-screen mode feature may sometimes not display correctly. Ensure the checkbox next to the pin window feature is selected for full screen.

## Required Python Libraries
To run this application, you will need the following Python libraries:
- `tkinter`: For creating the graphical user interface.
- `time`: For handling the timer functionalities.
- `sys`: For system-specific parameters and functions.
